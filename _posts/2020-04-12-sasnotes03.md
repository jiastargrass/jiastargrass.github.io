**Summarizing Data**

Creating an Accumulating Column (use of retain - set the initial value and accumulate)

In SAS, a missing value + any value = missing value

using SUM function can solve the problem as it ignores missing values.

```SAS
data houston_rain;
	set pg2.weather_houston;
	keep Date DailyRain YTDRain;
	retain YTDRain 0;
	YTDRain=sum(YTDRain,DailyRain);
run;
```

In this case above, if there is a row of DailyRain is missing, the accumulation stops working.
