**DATA Step Processing**  
1 - Compilation  
establish data attributes and rules for execution  
* Check for syntax errors
* Create the program data vector (PDV), containing columns and attributes (this is way length statement has to be before if statements)
* Establish rules for processing data in the PDV
* Create descriptor portion of output table  
(note: drop statement does not drop the column immediately, SAS makes a flag for that column and drops it later)  


2 - Execution  
read, manipulate, and write DATA
