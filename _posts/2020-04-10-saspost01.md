When you name a process **flow Autoexec**, SAS Enterprise Guide prompts you to run the **Autoexec** process flow with the 2 programs when you open the project. This makes it easy to recreate your data each time you start practicing in the course.

In addition to creating SAS Report output, you can create other output types.
    Click the Program tab and click Properties.
    Select Results > Customize result formats, styles, and behavior.
    Clear any selected check boxes and then select the PDF and Excel check boxes. Click OK.
